# About RTR Carpentry project
# RTR Carpentry & Roofing is the construction company I work for when not writing code.
# The companies website was originally just a Yellow Pages site built using Wix and was left unattended for about 8 years.
# I took it upon myself to rebuild the site with a little more style and added a few things (like correct directions to the shop instead of the post office)
# I then presented it to the boss and he loved it and requested that it became the new company website
